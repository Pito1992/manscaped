The link below is to a fake design of an order card. We would like you to develop this component out using your choice of technology stack. Once you access the link, create a Figma account and you should have access to the design comp. Here is a list of requirements in order to complete the challenge:

* Link to Figma design https://www.figma.com/file/t8xt4HF0oiDot6wDxfznqQ/MANSCAPED%E2%84%A2-Coding-Challenge?node-id=402%3A201

* Once the link is clicked, sign up for Figma to access the design

* Build the order card design out using your choice of tech stack (this can be as simple as an index.html file to a full react app)

* Provide a README file in your project so that we can run the application locally and view your work

* For desktop, follow the design. For mobile and tablet versions, use your best discretion on how you think is the best layout for those breakpoints

* The UI should be fully responsive from 375-1000px viewports

* Fully interactive page which means all interactive element should be interactive (ie. link, inputs, checkbox, dropdown, badge, tag, etc), each button should toggle a different modal (you can make up the modal content, they should be different, and can input data (a plus if the data is controlled by React)).

* A separated basic admin page, where the content of the card can be edited on that page (Order info, address, date, order items, number of items in order, etc... Please keep the control realistic, which means it should be usable in real world situation)

* Provide any comments in the code to help us understand thinking/strategy

* Do not spend more than 4 hours on the project



Criteria that weâ€™re looking for:

* React knowledge, if it can be written in NextJS, it will be a big plus

* Web fundamentals (semantic HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript is a plus, animation is a big plus)

* Coding style, coding organization

* Git usage

* Tests (optional)

* Live deployment (optional)
